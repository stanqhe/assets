# assets

This repository contains **public, reusable visual assets** maintained as a stable source of truth for images that intentionally represent my public identity over time.

The repository is designed to be minimal, durable, and platform-independent.

## Contents

- **Portraits**Curated profile images intended for long-term public use.
- **Photos**
  Selected travel and life photos used for narrative and contextual purposes.

All assets are published deliberately and referenced via stable URLs.

## Structure

assets/
├─ portraits/
└─ photos/

The directory structure is intentionally semantic-light and conservative.
Interpretation and narrative meaning are handled outside this repository.

## Usage

Assets may be embedded or referenced across websites, documents, and other public-facing materials.

Once an asset is published and referenced externally, its path is treated as immutable.

## License

Unless otherwise stated, all images in this repository are licensed under:

**Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial–NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)**

Sharing with attribution is permitted.
Commercial use or modification requires explicit permission.

## AI and Synthetic Media Notice

Use of these images for:

- AI model training,
- synthetic media generation,
- facial animation,
- voice pairing,
- impersonation, or
- creation of derivative or simulated representations

is **explicitly prohibited**.

This restriction applies regardless of whether such use is commercial or non-commercial.
